# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

• You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
• Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
• Read the file before you try to edit it.
• Due to Cursor's limit, when you use git and gh and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use git commit -F <filename> or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

• For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
• Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
• When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
• Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
